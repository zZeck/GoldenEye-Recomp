# GoldenEye 007 — PC Recompilation

A native PC port of **GoldenEye 007 (Xbox 360 / XBLA)**, built by *statically
recompiling* the original game into C++ with the
[ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/jeffory/GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue). No emulator —
the game runs as a real native executable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This repository contains _no_ game code or assets.** It is only the
> source that wraps the game (menus, hooks, online, post-FX, build
> config). You must find the game files yourself. This game never released publically

## Features

- Runs natively on **Windows** and **Linux** — no emulator, no BIOS — with an
  experimental **Android** (arm64) build.
- Controller support.
- **Online multiplayer** — host or join matches over the internet (LAN, Hamachi,
  playit.gg, or a public server). See [Playing online](#playing-online).
- In-game **pause / settings menu** (ESC): video, resolution, frame limit,
  fullscreen, online setup.
- **Post-FX** filters (brightness, contrast, saturation, vignette, presets…).
- **Weapon quick select** — instant switching via number keys / scroll wheel on
  PC, or a touch menu on the second screen of dual-screen Android handhelds.
  See [Weapon quick select](#weapon-quick-select).
- Smooth, stable 60 FPS (recompiled, with GPU-pacing fixes for the original's
  frame timing).

## Download & Play

Grab the latest prebuilt release from the **[Releases](../../releases)** page
(**Windows x64**, **Linux x86-64**, and an experimental **Android arm64-v8a**
APK are attached), then drop your own GoldenEye 007 game files into the `assets/`
folder next to the binary. Run `ge.exe` on Windows or `./ge` on Linux; on Android
install the (debug-signed) APK.

## Playing online

1. One person runs the **[server](https://github.com/SunJaycy/GoldenEye-Recomp-Server)**
   and shares its address + port.
2. Everyone opens **ESC → ONLINE** in the game, enters their **username**, the
   **server address**, the **port**, ticks *Enable online play*, and hits
   **Save & Restart**.
3. Host a match; the others find and join it.

Because players connect *out* to the server, no port-forwarding is needed for
joiners — only the host's server port has to be reachable.

## Weapon quick select

Switching weapons is **instant** — the port calls the game's own weapon-switch
routine directly instead of cycling through the inventory, so jumping from the
first weapon to the last takes one press. It's enabled by default and there are
two ways to use it, depending on platform:

- **PC (keyboard & mouse):**
  - **Number keys `1`–`9`** — jump straight to the Nth weapon you're carrying
    (in inventory order).
  - **Mouse scroll wheel** — scroll up/down to step to the next/previous
    carried weapon.
- **Android (dual-screen handhelds, e.g. AYN Thor):** the bottom touch panel
  shows a live weapon menu — every carried weapon with its ammo count, with the
  currently equipped one highlighted. **Tap a weapon to switch to it.** The main
  game on the top screen is unaffected. On single-screen devices the menu simply
  doesn't appear; nothing else changes.

The feature can be tuned via cvars: `ge_weapon_select_enable` turns it on/off,
and `ge_key_wpn_next` / `ge_key_wpn_prev` rebind the next/previous keys
(defaults `WheelUp` / `WheelDown`).

## Building from source (advanced)

Most people should just use the [Releases](../../releases). To build it yourself
you need the recompiler toolchain and your own copy of the game.

### Common prerequisites (all platforms)

- The [ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/jeffory/GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue) — a local
  checkout that provides the `rexglue` CLI + runtime. The build points at it via
  `-DREXSDK_DIR=/path/to/GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue`.
- **CMake 3.25+**, a **C++23 Clang** toolchain, and **Python 3** (used by codegen).
- Your own **GoldenEye 007 XBLA game files**, placed in `assets/`.

Every build starts with the same codegen step, run once from the repo root. It
turns *your* game copy into recompiled C++ under `generated/`:

```sh
rexglue codegen --max_jump_table_entries 2048 ge_config.toml
```

The desktop builds use [CMake presets](CMakePresets.json). Each platform/arch has
`-debug`, `-release`, and `-relwithdebinfo` variants
(`win-amd64`, `win-arm64`, `linux-amd64`, `linux-arm64`); swap the preset name in
the commands below to pick a different target or build type.

### Linux (x86-64)

- **Clang 18+** with **libc++** (`-stdlib=libc++`) — the SDK uses `std::expected` /
  `std::jthread`. The presets invoke plain `clang` / `clang++`; if your distro
  only ships versioned binaries (e.g. `clang-20`), either symlink them or override
  `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` / `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`.
- **Ninja** (the presets' generator).
- To install dependencies: 
- Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install \
  git cmake ninja-build build-essential pkg-config python3 \
  clang llvm lld libsdl3-dev libvulkan-dev \
  vulkan-tools mesa-vulkan-drivers \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev \
  libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libasound2-dev \
  libwayland-dev libdrm-dev libudev-dev
```
- Fedora:

```sh
sudo dnf install \
  git cmake ninja-build pkgconf-pkg-config python3 \
  clang llvm lld SDL3-devel vulkan-loader-devel \
  vulkan-tools mesa-vulkan-drivers \
  mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel \
  libXcursor-devel libXi-devel alsa-lib-devel \
  wayland-devel libdrm-devel systemd-devel
```
- Then you can build an optimized build specifically for your machine:
```sh
# 1. Build the ReXGlue SDK (codegen tool + runtime library).
cd GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_LINKER_TYPE=LLD \
  -DCMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION=ON \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-march=native -mtune=native" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native -mtune=native"
cd ..
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# 2. Generate the recompiled game code from your game files.
cd ..
REX_MAX_JUMP_TABLE_ENTRIES=2048 ./GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue/out/linux-amd64/rexglue codegen ge_manifest.toml

# 3. Configure the game project (links against the rexglue SDK in-tree).
cmake --preset linux-amd64-release \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
    -DCMAKE_LINKER_TYPE=LLD \
    -DCMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION=ON \
    -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-march=native -mtune=native" \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native -mtune=native" \
    -DREXSDK_DIR=GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue/

# 4. Build.
cmake --build --preset linux-amd64-release -j$(nproc)
mkdir release
cp out/build/linux-amd64-release/ge release/
cp GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue/out/linux-amd64/librexruntime.so release/
cp GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue/out/linux-amd64/libTracyClient.so release/
cp -r assets release/
```

### Windows (x64)

- **Clang** (LLVM, `clang` / `clang++`) inside a **Visual Studio (MSVC)**
  environment — open an *x64 Native Tools* developer prompt so the MSVC headers
  and libs are on `PATH`.
- **Ninja** and **CMake** (both ship with the VS installer's CMake component).

```bat
:: After running codegen above, from the x64 Native Tools prompt:
cmake --preset win-amd64-relwithdebinfo -DREXSDK_DIR=C:\path\to\GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue
cmake --build --preset win-amd64-relwithdebinfo
:: Binary: out\build\win-amd64-relwithdebinfo\ge.exe
```

### Android (arm64-v8a, experimental)

Builds an APK with Gradle + the NDK, which drives this same CMake. `arm64-v8a`
only (the guest reserves a 4 GiB address space).

- Android SDK + **NDK 27.1.12297006** (Vulkan-capable).
- The ReXGlue SDK checkout, passed as `-PrexSdkDir` (default
  `../../GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue`).

```sh
# After running codegen above:
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease -PrexSdkDir=/path/to/GoldenEye-Recomp-rexglue
# APK: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/
```

Install the (debug-signed) APK on a controller-equipped device. On-device
game-asset delivery is still being wired up, and cold boot uses an auto-retry
watchdog. See [`android/README.md`](android/README.md) for how the
NativeActivity / Vulkan-surface shell wires together, and
[`docs/boot-startup-race.md`](docs/boot-startup-race.md) for the boot race.

> [!NOTE]
> **Continuous integration.** Every push is compile-verified on **Linux, Windows,
> and Android** via GitHub Actions
> ([`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml)): it checks the
> hand-written engine sources against the SDK headers on all three platforms. CI
> can't produce the final `ge` binary — that needs generated PPC code from *your*
> own game copy.

source lives in [`src/`](src/):
`ge_app` (app + window/menus glue), `ge_menu` (pause/settings menu),
`ge_hooks` (mid-asm fixups), `ge_postfx` (filters). `ge_manifest.toml` /
`ge_config.toml` drive the recompiler.
